fringejs
========
A Prototype-based JavaScript Web Application Framework designed to meet ECMAScript 5 standards.

####Browser Support:
fringejs has not been actively tested, but should work on all ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers.


####What is "Prototype-based" and why is it important?
JavaScript, unlike many object oriented programming languages, has prototypical inheritance rather than classical inheritance.
This means objects can directly inherit other objects, as opposed to the classical languages where a subclass inherits from a superclass, and objects are instances of classes.

Many similar frameworks use a pseudo classical inheritance pattern where they attempt to mimic classical inheritance by creating instances of a function and using the function's prototype to inherit the class structure. fringejs, however, uses prototypical inheritance because JavaScript is Prototype-based.


####ECMAScript 5 standards:
To ensure fringejs can be run cross-browser, it is written to the ECMAScript 5 standard. Therefore, it should work on all ECMAScript 5 compliant browser.
