fringejs
========
A Prototype-based JavaScript Web Application Framework designed to meet ECMAScript 5 standards.

#####Browser Support:
fringejs has not been activly tested, but should work on all ECMAScript 5 complient browsers.

####What is "Prototype-based" and why is it important?
JavaScript, unlike many object oriented programming languages, has prototypical inheritence rather than classical inheritence.
This means objects can directly inherit other objects, as opposed to the classical languages where a subclass inherits from a superclass, and objects are instances of classes.

Many similar frameworks use a psuedo classical inheritence pattern where they attempt to mimic classical inheritence by creating instances of a function and using the function's prototype to inherit the class structure. fringejs, however, uses prototypical inheritence because JavaScript is Prototype-based.

####ECMAScript 5 standards:
To ensure fringejs can be run cross-browser, it is written to the ECMAScript 5 standard. Therefore, it should work on all ECMAScript 5 complient browser.
